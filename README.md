"Hi, I'm Sri! I'm a married mom of two with a passion for living life to the fullest. With a background in Physical Therapy and an MBA, I've got a unique blend of skills. When I'm not working, you can find me snuggled up with a good book, hooking away on my crochet projects, or designing dresses. I'm also a green thumb who loves tending to my garden and cooking up a storm in the kitchen. But my favorite thing to do? Exploring new places and being outdoors with my family. Life is an adventure, and I'm excited to see what's around the next corner!"
